# Steganography
This project uses a technique in which the AES encryption algorithm is used for performing cryptography and the LSB algorithm for steganography for the purpose of achieving a greater level of security when sending sensitive information, especially across social media platforms. Java, the programming language, is utilized both for its superior ease of use as well as its various comprehensive libraries.
